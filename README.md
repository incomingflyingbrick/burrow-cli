# Share part of your GPU with your friends!

* With Burrow, you can share part of your GPU with your friends with a single link! 🚀🔗
* Work collaboratively in the same terminal, especially thanks to sshx.io 👨‍💻👩‍💻
* With security in mind, Burrow uses sandbox Docker containers, so your friends can't access your local files. 🛡️🐳🔒

# Install
## Prerequises
* Burrow requires Docker to run. It will install Docker on your local machine if it's not already installed. The automated Docker installation only works on Ubuntu; if you are using other Linux distributions, you will need to install Docker yourself first.
